// Beware of Serial.print() speed.  Without interrupts, if you
// transmit too much data with Serial.print() it can slow your
// reading from Encoder.  Arduino 1.0 has improved transmit code.

// buffering.  But all boards can experience problems if you print
// too much and fill up buffers.

// Change these two numbers to the pins connected to your encoder.
//   With ENCODER_DO_NOT_USE_INTERRUPTS, no interrupts are ever
//   used, even if the pin has interrupt capability
